          To sell items on BidMart, you must first create an account if you do not already have one. Once you are logged in, click the "Sell Item" button in the top right corner of the homepage. Follow the prompts to enter information about the item you are selling, including its title, description, and starting price. You can also add photos to make your item more appealing to potential buyers.
          Once you have listed your item, it will be available for bidding by other users on BidMart. When the auction ends, you will be notified by email if your item has been sold. At that point, you can complete the payment and shipping process with the buyer. If your item does not sell, you can relist it or choose to keep it.

          Once you have placed a bid on an auction, it cannot be cancelled or retracted. It is important to carefully review the item listing and the amount you wish to bid before submitting your bid. Placing a bid is a binding contract, and failure to follow through with payment may result in your account being suspended or closed. If you have any questions or concerns about placing a bid, please contact BidMart customer support for assistance.
