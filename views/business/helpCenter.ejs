        <h2>Bidding</h2>
        <p>To place a bid on an item in an auction, simply click the "Bid Now" button next to the item. Enter the amount you want to bid and click "Submit Bid". Please note that bids are binding, so make sure you are willing to pay the amount you bid before submitting.</p>
        <h3>Outbidding and Maximum Bids</h3>
        <p>If someone else places a bid on the same item, you will be notified via email and in your BidMart account dashboard. To continue bidding, simply enter a higher bid amount. You can also use BidMart's maximum bid feature to set a maximum bid amount that you are willing to pay for an item. The system will automatically bid on your behalf up to your maximum bid amount, helping you stay in the lead while you're away from your computer.</p>
        <h3>Auto Bidding</h3>
        <p>Currently, BidMart does not offer auto bidding functionality. However, we are always working to improve our platform and may add this feature in the future.</p>
        <p>Here you can learn about bidding on auctions.</p>
        <p>When you find an item you want to bid on, click the "Bid Now" button and enter your bid amount. You will be prompted to confirm your bid before it is submitted. If someone outbids you, you will receive a notification via email and on your BidMart account dashboard.</p>
<p>Please note that bids cannot be retracted, so make sure to bid carefully and only bid what you can afford. If you are the highest bidder when the auction ends, you will be notified by email and on your BidMart account dashboard.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about bidding or need assistance with placing a bid, please contact our customer support team.</p>

      <section id="payments">
        <h2>Payments</h2>
        <p>At the moment, BidMart does not have a payment system in place. When you win an auction, you will be notified by email. In this email, you will receive the seller's contact information and you can contact them directly to arrange for payment and delivery of your item.</p>
<p>It's important to note that the seller may have their own preferred payment method, so it's important to discuss this with them. We recommend using a secure payment method to protect yourself from fraud.</p>
<p>If you have any questions or concerns about the payment process, please feel free to <a href="#contact">contact us</a> and we will be happy to assist you.</p>
